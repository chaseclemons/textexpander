Please Note: I work M-F 8am-5pm Central Time. It's %I:%M%p Central Time right now. Replies outside of that might be a bit slower.

If you'd like an answer outside of those hours, the quickest route is to send us a new ticket at 
https://basecamp.com/support. One of our other awesome support pros will get you an answer back right away!
